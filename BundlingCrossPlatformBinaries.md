This [Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29530261/how-to-use-jnaerator-with-multiple-dynamic-libraries-under-one-header) explains how to use the `-arch` [command-line flag](CommandLineOptionsAndEnvironmentVariables.md) multiple times in order to [bundle binaries in the format expected by BridJ](https://code.google.com/p/bridj/wiki/LibrariesLookup).

TODO also explain what the JNAerator runtime (which is JNA + some JNAerator-specific classes such as `LibraryExtractor`) can do.
